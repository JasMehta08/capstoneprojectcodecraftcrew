Problem given -> DA-IICT Club Manager

You need to build a manager for all the DA-IICT clubs. The manager ensures that
a club member can be looked up in minimum time. A member can either be a
faculty or a student. One should be able to search by name, ID, specific club
name, or club category (i.e., arts, science & technology, sports, culture). Note that
the user of this manager may not be a DA-IICT-ian and, therefore, may not know
the clubsâ€™ names.
