Problem given -> DA-IICT Club Manager

Problem statement -> You need to build a manager for all the DA-IICT clubs. The manager ensures that
a club member can be looked up in minimum time. A member can either be a
faculty or a student. One should be able to search by name, ID, specific club
name, or club category (i.e., arts, science & technology, sports, culture). Note that
the user of this manager may not be a DA-IICT-ian and, therefore, may not know
the clubsâ€™ names.

We have built DA-IICT club manager which can perform the following main functionalities:
-> Searches a student by Id and displays his/her details related to clubs.
-> Searches a student by name and displays his/her details related to clubs.
-> When searched using club name, it displays the club list which includes members of the club and their respective Ids.
-> When searched using club type, it displays list of all clubs of the same type (including Ids and names of members).

Besides these, we have given multiple additional functionalities:
-> Users are given a choice whether they want the output to be shown in console or in a file.
-> User can have access to the information of events organised by clubs.
      ->
-> User can check and modify budget of the clubs.
